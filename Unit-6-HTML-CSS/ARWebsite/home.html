            <p> I’m currently learning front-end web development with a focus on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As someone naturally drawn to both creativity and structure, coding has become the perfect space to grow. I enjoy building clean, responsive designs and bringing ideas to life through the browser.

             <p> Blogging Through the Learning Process
                As I develop my technical skills, I document my learning experience through blogging and digital content. I believe in learning out loud — sharing challenges, wins, and useful resources that might help others starting their own journey in tech.

                <p>I’m proudly from the west side of Detroit (Brightmoor). My city has taught me the value of resilience, originality, and hustle. I bring that energy into everything I create — whether it’s a website, a video, or a new skill I’m learning.

                <p>Building a Creative Tech Presence
                    Outside of code, I create lifestyle and tech-focused content across platforms like TikTok and YouTube. My goal is to merge creativity and technology in a way that inspires others — especially young Black women — to explore careers in STEM and digital creation.
                    Lastly Being a dog mom has added structure to my life while I balance self-paced learning, content creation, and my 9–5. It’s helped me build better habits, stay disciplined, and commit to long-term growth — all of which supports my goals in tech.
